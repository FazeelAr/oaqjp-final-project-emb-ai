# oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai

This project addresses the need for accurate and efficient emotion detection from text input.  It provides a Python-based solution for identifying the dominant emotion in sentences, converting data between text and CSV formats, and includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability. This project is intended for developers and researchers working with natural language processing and sentiment analysis.


## Key Features

*   **Emotion Detection:**  Identifies the dominant emotion (joy, anger, disgust, sadness, fear) in input sentences.
*   **Data Conversion:**  Converts data from semicolon-delimited text files to CSV format for easier processing.
*   **Unit Testing:** Includes a test suite using `unittest` to verify the accuracy of the emotion detection function.

## Installation

This project requires Python 3.  The exact dependencies are yet to be determined.  TODO:  Maintainer should list dependencies in `requirements.txt` and update this section.


**Steps:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<username>/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai
    ```
3.  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```
4.  Install dependencies (TODO: Replace with actual dependencies once `requirements.txt` is created):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

TODO: Add usage examples once the `emotion_detection` module's API is documented.  This section should include code examples showing how to use the `emotion_detector` function and the `txtTocsv.py` script.


## Configuration / Environment Variables

No configuration or environment variables are currently required.


## Dependencies / Tech Stack

*   Python 3
*   `unittest` (for testing)
*   TODO: Add other dependencies once determined.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.  Follow standard GitHub contribution guidelines.


## Roadmap

*   Define and document the API for the `emotion_detection` module.
*   Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all project dependencies.
*   Add comprehensive usage examples to the README.
*   Expand the test suite for broader coverage.
